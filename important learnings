Take frequent breaks---eyes and knee are two things which eventually going to give me hard time so delay the time as much as possible.

Set realy smart goals -pick your battles right and feedback loop for the constant check where or not i am on track.

make yourself real busy in different hobbies.

long term rewards -- have some rewards in life over time.

people are on different pages of their life so it's not fair to compare yourself to them and work on thing you want to accomplish.

make notes effectively and organise them real nice.
